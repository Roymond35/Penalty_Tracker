Potential Enhancements to be made to the Penalty Tracker during the off season
--------------------

- Store the data in a better way.
    - Currently the data is being stored inefficiently. Since I plan on storing MORE data, I have to store this better.
- Store more data
    - Some initial ideas are
        - Timestamps of the penalties
        - Where there was a goal scored on the resulting powerplay
- Apps!
    - (Think this out more...)
