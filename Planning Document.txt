Planning for the second iteration of my Penalty Counter

Issues with the first iteration:
	-Downloading all of the box scores
		In the previous version of the program, I required the end-user to download all of the box scores. This was a very lazy method of obtaining the data and was very costly both in time and in disk space as the full 82 game season for 30 teams took up 114 MB.
	-There was no automated testing of algorithms
		Because I did not know how to do true test automation, I couldn't verify that the algorithm to parse through the data was accurate enough to catch every instance. This led to me manually comparing the generated result to what the NHL had on their website.
	-Data Storage was HORRENDOUS.
		I had to parse through EVERY file every time the program was ran. This was a huge time sink. Realistically the program should be able to determine the last time it was ran and gather the data from that point to the current date. This also meant that I wasn't running it very often.
	-I had to run the program manually.
		Ideally, this program should be stored on a server somewhere and automatically ran every day at a certain time.

		
Ideas for next iteration:
	-Enhance the program so that it does not have to download all of the box scores.
	-Insert automated testing to insure that the algorithm is correctly parsing through the data.
		-Python has a module called "unittest" that could be leveraged if nothing else
		-This would require me manually going through and counting the penalties in a select number of games.
	-Enhance the program so it will remember the last time it was ran and only search between that last time and the current date.
	-Automate the program.
		-Investigate how
	-USE AN OBJECT ORIENTATED DESIGN
		- I was storing every penalty event as an array that was then inserted into another array. This was definitely a bad practice as I could have easily written a class to do this cleaner.

		
Talking Point on 7/28
--------------------
Would I ever need to have the master list sorted by aspect?
	-Initial thought is I do not need to worry about this at the lower levels. This can be be done at the high level Javascript. Reddit can do it therefore it can be done quickly and interactively.
	-I just need to generate the HTML file correctly.
	
	
	
Update on 8/31
--------------------
I have three weeks until my hockey starts up again. This means that I have time to actually work on this substantially and get it done.

What needs to be done though:
	- 	Using the Windows Task Scheduler, I need to set up a task that runs at 1AM every day to update the penalties from the game.
	-	I need to make it so that the program remembers when it last ran and only looks at the games it hasn't seen
	-	I need to record the penalties from these games
	-	I need to upload a copy of the recorded penalties to a front facing web server (Something others can grab)
	-	Once this is in place, I will need to write the website to deal with the UI elements of it.
