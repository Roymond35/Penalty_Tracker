# Penalty Counter
---------
Written by Roy Gero in Python 2.7.10 using object orientated design

## Purpose of the Program
Every NHL season there are 1,230 games played between the 30 teams and each one of these games, there can be any number of penalties called. I want to provide people with the ability to make more informed statements when it comes to penalties that occur. The way that this program performs this is by searching the NHL website and gathering all the penalties that occur. After gathering the information, the program hands a text file to a website. This website, seen in the repo "[Penalty Counter Website](https://github.com/Roymond35/PenaltyCounterWebsite)" takes the parameters the user is looking for and parses the text file for anything that matches.

## Things learned through this project
* unittest module - One of the skill I wanted to strengthen was the ability to think through and use automated tests to insure that changes made to algorithms or functions didn't change the overall result.
* ftp module - This was a smaller area I wanted to improve upon, however, programmatically accessing a website through the Python 2.7.10 ftp module was something I did want to learn.
