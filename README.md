# Penalty Tracker
---------
Penalty Tracker is a program written by Roy Gero. The purpose of this program is going to be a web scraper that parses through the box scores for NHL games and creates a database of all the penalties called in the season. With this database, an end user can search for the number of times a certain penalty was called, a number of times a team had a penalty called on them, as well as some other criteria.

It is my intention to have the user be able to generate HTML Reports based on the search criteria they enter.

This project is also going to be an example of my abilities to create unit tests using the module "unittest" provided in Python 2.7.10
